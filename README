    Test::Lib - Use libraries from a t/lib directory

SYNOPSIS
        use Test::Lib;
        use Test::More;
        use Private::Testing::Module;
    
        ok 1, 'passing test';
        my_test 'test from private module';

DESCRIPTION
    Searches upward from the calling module for a directory t with a lib
    directory inside it, and adds it to the module search path. Looks upward
